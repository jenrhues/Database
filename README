Description: This program is meant to access a specific database. Buttons are implemented to display information from the 
  database to the user in text boxes. The program was made under the assumption that no one would try to break it.
Difficulties: I had trouble connecting my database to the WPF, and I could not figure out what was wrong with my connection
  string name. After a lot of slamming my head on the desk, I was able to refocus on find that one "\" was causing all of
  my trouble. Then, I had trouble opening the database because I had not written a closing statement.
Design: The buttons are yellow and orange because that is what comes to mind when I think of a database. There is no sense
  to it besides a feeling. Also, the colors are not terrible to look at for a moment. The text is outputted with labels in
  the same color text box. The gradient made it less boring. The boxes take up the majority of the screen because that is
  all the program was meant to do.
Future: If I had more time to work on this project, I would have attempted the bonus, which wanted the ability to add to the
  database.
